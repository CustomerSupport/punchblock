PUNCHBLOCK
==========

Punchblock is a middleware library for telephony applications.  Like Rack is to
Rails and Sinatra, Punchblock provides a consistent API on top of several
underlying third-party call control protocols.

Design
------

In the same spirit that inspired Rack, the Punchblock library is envisioned to
be the single library for call control wiring.  Frameworks and applications may
take advantage of Punchblock's single API to write powerful code for managing
calls.  Punchblock is not and will not be an application framework; rather it
only surfaces the various protocols and presents a consistent interface to its
consumers.

Supported Protocols
-------------------

Punchblock is still in very early stages so this list
is what we plan to support:

* Ozone (Tropo, Voxeo Prism)
* AGI/AMI (Asterisk)
* EventSocket (FreeSWITCH, maybe)
